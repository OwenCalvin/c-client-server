# A simple networking implementation in C
Basically it was a school project but it gives a basis to code server implementations in C

# client-server-tcp
```bash
$ cd client-server-tcp
$ make
$ ./server 4000
$ ./client 127.0.0.1 4000
$ make clean
```  
Just type some stuff inside the client console, it will be displayed on the server's one

# client-server-udp
```bash
$ cd client-server-udp
$ make
$ ./server 4000
$ ./client 127.0.0.1 4000
$ make clean
```  
Just type some stuff inside the client console, it will be displayed on the server's one

# client-http
An example to create a HTTP requester (or any other protocol)
```bash
$ cd client-http
$ make
$ make test
$ make clean
```
